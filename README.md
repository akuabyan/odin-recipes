# odin-recipes

This current project is about some recipes and after i complete this i will have the nescessary skills to make a basic website.

The food that i decided on is completely random, although nasi goreng is here because im indonesian.

After making this simple website i realize i forgot a couple of things that i have been taught, like how to put an image or specific shortcuts or how to push and commit. Completing this assignment refreshes my memory and seeing the progress i made from going back and forth between previous lessons to now making a recipe site in 1 go, it made me feel good. Although i did google whats the shortcut to insert a new line since the lessons doesn't say. Other than that it was fun! I haven't seen other peoples solution to this assignment but i know their websites are far better than what i have.

I may have forgotten to commit individual changes instead of commiting the entire project.

The website now looks better now that i have learned some css, although some parts art inconsistent, it is a step in the right direction.
